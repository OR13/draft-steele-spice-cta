1.  Introduction

   Requirements for physical supply chain credentials are subject to
   frequent changes due to regulatory, logistic and market pressures.
   Preventing fraud and counterfeiting requires strong cryptographic
   assurance and binding to identities for people, organizations,
   vehicles and devices.  New information regarding a credential subject
   needs to be conveyed by holders to verifier, after credential
   issuance.  This specification describes the role of credential types
   or schemas in supporting changing requirements and realtime
   information regarding digital credentials.

   When products in a physical supply chain are produced, it is common
   for certain required information to become available over time,
   sometimes as a result or tranformation processes which can be
   performed in different locations.

   When creating a digital twin or product passport for a marketable
   product, the issuer needs to balance the need to create identifiers
   as soon as possible, so that claims can be associated to them, with
   the need to wait for sufficient claims to be available to justify a
   credential issuance.

   A credential type or credential schema, is a set of mandatory and
   optional data elements, and is often based on a paper document such
   as a government form, or an evaluation or test performed by a trusted
   third party.

   When specifying digital representation of product information, it is
   common to encounter data elements which are "required when present",
   but which do not become present for some time after credential
   issuance.

   For example, when producing steel products, the chemical composition
   of steel is determined at the location and time when the steel is
   still in liquid form.  However, mechanical properties, including
   length, weight and other dimensions as well as material properties
   such as tensile strength become available later as the raw product is
   further refined on its journey to the end customer.  In particular,
   attributes such as protective coatings or finishing details which can
   impact weight and price may only be available shortly after the
   product is purchased.  These attributes are critical to intermediate
   supply chain parties, such as logistics providers, who need to load
   and unload product from vessels or vehicles.  Accurate information
   regarding dimensions and weight is critical to estimating fuel costs,
   and enabling advanced models of supply chain activity based on
   realtime digital twins.

   In some cases, flaws in a batch of products are discovered only after
   transport has begun, and downstream supply chain partners need access
   to the latest information regarding a product in order to comply with
   regulatory or business policies.

   Traditionally these challenges have been solved for with combinations
   of the following recommendations:

   *  Issue small credentials linked together with a common identifier

   *  Enable the latest revocation, suspension or other status
      information to be retrieved in realtime

   *  Use credential types or schemas to distinguish credentials with
      different required fields

   *  Use a confirmation method to selectively disclosed attributes to a
      single credential

   Depending on the nature of the new information associated to a
   credential, these approaches can be difficult to implement, consume
   needless resources such as CPU, memory or network bandwidth, or
   reveal confidential supply chain metadata such as location
   information associated with a credential verification.

   This document proposes a simple profile for JOSE and COSE based
   credentials, enabling simple, secure and efficient realtime digital
   twins.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses many terms common to the digital credential
   ecosystem and the OAUTH, SCITT, SPICE, JOSE and COSE working groups.

   Media Type:  JWT and CWT credential formats support the use of media
      types to identify the claimset (cty) and the entire secured object
      (typ).  This specification relates these media type extension
      points to other application specific extension points such as
      verifiable credential type (vct).

   Credential ID:  CWT ID (CTI) and JWT ID (JTI) as defined in
      Section 3.1.7 of [RFC8392], are used to identify a digital
      credential represented as a token.

   Credential Type:  Section 3.2.2.1.1 of
      [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] and Section TBD of
      [I-D.draft-prorock-spice-cose-sd-cwt] describe a stringOrURI based
      identifier for distinguishing required or optional JWT or CWT
      claims.

   Credential Schema:  Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0
      (https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#data-schemas) describes
      solutions for validating instances of a JSON data model.  This
      specification generalizes this approach to support validating
      instances of JWT or CWT claimsets similar to the approach taken in
      [I-D.draft-ietf-rats-eat], by relating the use of schema languages
      to the vct claim in JWT or CWT.

   Credential Assertions:  [I-D.draft-demarco-oauth-status-attestations]
      describes a mechanism whereby a holder can retrieve updated
      credential state from an issuer, and present it to a verifier.

   Credential Status Lists:  [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-status-list]
      describes a mechanism whereby a verifier can retrieve updated
      credential states for a list of credentials from an issuer.

3.  Overview

   This section describes how supply chain event driven architectures
   can be mapped to high level digital credential workflows to support
   digital twin ecosystems.

+---------+ ... +-------------+ ... +-------------+ ... +--------------+
| Product |     | Product     |     |  Product    |     |  Regulations |
| Created |     | Transformed |     |  Transfered |     |  Updated     |
+-----+---+     +------+------+     +-------+-----+     +-------+------+
      |                |                    |                   |
      v                v                    v                   v
+-----+------+   +-----+------+     +-------+-------+   +-------+------+
| Credential |   | Credential |     |  Credential   |   |  Credential  |
| Identifier |   | Claims     |     |  Confirmation |   |  Schema      |
| Created    |   | Added      |     |  Updated      |   |  Updated     |
+------------+   +------------+     +---------------+   +--------------+

   Although the figure above suggests a linear ordering of events,
   complex supply chains also known as value networks often combine
   component products into higher order products over time with events
   arriving out of order or for products which are not yet known to the
   stakeholder.

   Regulations and therefor credential types requirements can change
   after or during a product custody transfers, making responsibility
   for compliance difficult.  When requirements change, or in certain
   policy situations, additional information might be required from one
   or more supply chain actors, for example a border agent might request
   specific information from the original manufacturer and the logistics
   providers that are partnered to transport products.

   Businesses account for these changes today through a combination of
   messages exchanged over email or through proprietary digital document
   management systems.

   As workflows for producing physical or digital products embrace
   transparency, traceability and security enabled by digital
   credentials, using the correct extension points at the the correct
   time becomes essential to reducing data duplication, and improving
   speed and security.

   The following sections cover guidance for when to use specific
   extension points which are available to profiles built on JOSE and
   COSE credential formats.

4.  Entity Identifiers

   It is important to distinguish subject entity identifiers (sub or
   iss) for a product, organization or device, from credential
   identifiers such as cti or jti.  Credential identifiers are used to
   name a set of secured claims about a subject.  Consider that in the
   future, a supply chain party may wish to aggregate all credentials
   associated with a product identifier such as serial number, including
   multiple credentials from the same or different issuers.  In these
   cases, the subject identifer can be considered as a primary key for
   the product, and the credential id can be considered as a foreign key
   for a table with columns representing the claims available for the
   token type (typ) and then finally the credential type (vct).

   For example:

  Token Type                    Verifiable Credential Type
  +-----------------------+     +--------------------------------------+
  | typ: foo-passport+jwt |     | vct: https://.../foo-passport/v1.2.3 |
  | (jti, iss, sub)       |     | (product_name, serial_number)        |
  +---------+-------------+     +--------------------+-----------------+
            |                                        |
            |                                        |
            |         Credential Instance            |
            |         +----------------------+       |
            |         | jti: urn:uuid:123... |       |
            +-------->| ... typ claims ...   |       |
                      | ... vct claims ...   +<------+
                      | sub: urn:uuid:456... |
                      +-----------+----------+
                                  |
  Internal System                 |
  +----------------------+        |
  | id: 0xfacade123...   |        |
  | sub: urn:uuid:456... +<-------+
  +----------------------+

5.  Credential & Token Types

   Per [RFC8725] it is considered a best practice for both COSE and JOSE
   based digital credentials to distinguish types of tokens using the
   typ header parameter, which is used to indicate the media type of the
   associated token (including protected headers and signatures or
   ciphertexts).  As described in Section 3.2.2.1.1 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] and Section TBD of
   [I-D.draft-prorock-spice-cose-sd-cwt] the type of a JWT or CWT
   claimset can also be constrained using the vct CWT or JWT claim.  It
   is recommended that both typ and vct be used when possible, and that
   application specific constraints which might be extended, updated or
   changed frequently be expressed through vct.  The specific semantics
   of vct have been left intentionally open to support many use cases.
   A value of vct indicating https://issuer.gov.example/foo-passport/
   v1.2.3 might be present in a credential of media type application/
   foo-passport+jwt and application/foo-passport+cwt.  In other words,
   it is recommended to not include media type parameters which using
   typ parameters.  When versioning is necessary, it should be performed
   in the context of mandatory and optional claims and communicated
   throught the vct property.  Although the example above includes a
   version identifier in the example URI, version information could be
   requested in other ways, including via HTTP headers.  When HTTP is
   used to transport credential type information it is recommended to
   support negotiation of the credential type requirements through the
   use of the Accept Header.  This enables human and machine readable
   requirements to be supported for each version of a digital
   credential.

   For example:

   GET https://issuer.gov.example/foo-passport Accept: application/cddl
   or application/schema+json or text/html; charset=utf-8

5.1.  Schemas

   Schemas are another name for verifiable credential type.  Schemas
   constrain the expected mandatory and optional fields, and can
   recognize if an instance of a credential is valid according a data
   definition lanugage such as JSON Schema or CDDL.  Schemas can be used
   to convey updated requirements associated with a credential, such as
   new fields which are mandatory in a new version.  A new schema and
   associated status assertions can be conveyed using the mechanism
   described in [I-D.draft-demarco-oauth-status-attestations].  This
   enables a holder of a credential to disclose the original credential
   with confirmation, and any new information or requirements that have
   changed since the original credential was issued.

   For example:

   cbor-diag / cose-sign1 / 18([ / protected / << { / alg / 1 : -35 /
   ES384 / / typ / 16 : "application/sd+cwt" / kid / :
   "https://issuer.gov.example/key-42" } >>, / unprotected / { /
   disclosed claims / / sd_claims / TBD1 : <<[ [ / salt /
   h'399c641e...2aa18c1e', / claim / "region", / value / "ca" /
   California / ], [ / salt / h'82501bb4...6c655f32', / value / "4.1.7"
   ] ] / sd_kbt / TBD2 : << [ / protected / << { / alg / 1 : -35 / ES384
   / / typ / 16 : "application/kb+cwt" } >>, / unprotected / {}, /
   payload / << / cnonce / 39 : h'e0a156bb3f', / aud / 3 :
   "https://verifier.example", / iat / 6 : 1783000000, / sd_alg / TBD4 :
   -16 /SHA-256/ / sd_hash / TBD3 : h'c341bb...4a5f3f', / hash of
   sd_claims / / using sd_alg / >>, / signature / h'1237af2e...6789456'
   ] >> }, / payload / << / iss / 1 : "https://issuer.example", / sub /
   2 : "https://device.example", / vct / TBD10 :
   "https://issuer.gov.example/foo-passport/v1.2.3", / exp / 2 :
   1883000000, / iat / 2 : 1683000000, / cnf / 8 : { / cose key / 1 : {
   / alg: ES256 / 3: 35, / kty: EC2 / 1: 2, / crv: P-256 / -1: 1, / x /
   -2: h'768ed8...8626e', / y / -3: h'6a48cc...fd5d5' } }, / status /
   TBD8 : { / status assertion / TBD9 : { / credential hash alg / :
   "sha-256" } }, / sd_alg / TBD4 : -16, / SHA-256 / / redacted
   measurements / -65537 : [ { TBD6 : h'45dd...87af' / redacted_element
   / } ], "address": { "country" : "us", / United States / /
   redacted_keys / TBD5 : [ h'adb70604...03da225b', / redacted region /
   h'e04bdfc4...4d3d40bc' / redacted post_code / ] } >>, / signature /
   h'3337af2e...66959614' ])

   The associated status assertion could convey updated measurments that
   the issuer was not aware of at the time they issued the associated
   SD-CWT.

   For example:

   cbor-diag / cose-sign1 / 18([ / protected / << { / alg / 1 : -35 /
   ES384 / / typ / 16 : "application/status-assertion+cwt" / kid / :
   "https://issuer.gov.example/key-42" } >>, / unprotected / {}, /
   payload / << / iss / 1 : "https://issuer.example", / sub / 2 :
   "https://device.example", / vct / TBD10 :
   "https://issuer.gov.example/foo-passport/v2.0.0", / exp / 2 :
   1883000000, / iat / 2 : 1683000000, / credential hash / TBD :
   h'227a33...45975', / credential hash alg / TBD : "sha-256", / cnf / 8
   : { / Note this must match the original confirmation method / / cose
   key / 1 : { / alg: ES256 / 3: 35, / kty: EC2 / 1: 2, / crv: P-256 /
   -1: 1, / x / -2: h'768ed8...8626e', / y / -3: h'6a48cc...fd5d5' } },
   / realtime updates for / -65548 : { / last location geohash / 282 :
   h'542aaa...66559ff' } >>, / signature / h'627aff...649596dd' ])

   Note that in the example above the status assertion added realtime
   location information which was not present in the original credential
   type https://issuer.gov.example/foo-passport/v1.2.3, but which is
   mandatory in the new credential type https://issuer.gov.example/foo-
   passport/v2.0.0.

   Status assertions allow for new schemas and new credential type
   mandatory properties to be added over time, without issuing fresh
   credentials or updating existing schemas.

   However, there are cases where a new credential MUST be issued, and
   they are covered in the next section.

6.  Confirmation

   Confirmation methods and their associated claims are used to ensure
   that only the authorized holder of a credential retaining the ability
   to use the associated confirmation method, can present the credential
   and receive facilitation benefits.

   Confirmation is critical to prevent credential theft and forgery, but
   it introduces complications to supply chain workflows that might have
   previously relied on a bearer token or bearer documents.

   When custody of a product is transfered for example in relation to a
   bill of lading and mate receipt for an ocean liner vessel, the
   controller of the product credential and the associated digital twin
   needs to be updated.

   This can be accomplished through an issuance of a new credential,
   binding to the receiver of the product via their confirmation method,
   and a revocation of the previous credential to ensure the original
   holder is no longer able to present the proof of custody credential
   associated with the product shipment.

   There exist other registry updates which might be required to support
   product traceability such as notifications to shared databases or new
   entries in a certificate transparency system.

   After a new credential has been issued, the ability to provide status
   assertions transfers from the previous issuer, to the new issuer.

   It is essential that the validity period of associated credentials be
   aligned to the revocation and issuance process to ensure that the
   latest product information come from the current authoritative issuer
   for the product, and that the fresh status assertions be presentable
   by the current holder, and with the latest confirmation methods.

7.  Status

   Status information regarding a credential can be expressed in several
   ways including those described in [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-status-list]
   and [I-D.draft-demarco-oauth-status-attestations].  It is important
   to note that while status assertions are bound to the holder of a
   credential thought the associated confirmation method, status list
   information can be aggregated across several issuers over time, and
   issuer's might a previous issuer's authority to communicate status
   information for a newly issued credential.  In these cases,
   credential may have 1 or more associated status lists, and a single
   associated status assertion.

8.  Verifier Policies

   Supply chain actors for who receive credential presentations decide
   how to interpret the associated claims presented.  In some cases, a
   verifier might reject presentations of a credential that did not
   include fresh status assertions for the latest version of a schema
   describing the required elements in a digital twin.  For example, if
   a vessel leaves a port with bill of lading version 1, and regulations
   change in transit, a port authority might reject presentations of
   bill of lading version 1 unless they are companied with an assoicated
   status assertion covering the required data elements associated with
   bill of lading version 2.  A verifier might also communicate with the
   holder out of band, and decide to accept the presentation of revoked
   or outdated credentials based on internal information of confidential
   evidence provided by the holder.  It can be useful, especially when
   crafting machine readable and enforcable verifier policies, to refer
   to token types typ and crendential types vct explicitly.  It can also
   be useful to refer to specific supported protocol versions in a
   machine readable way, because certain credential features are only
   available to specific credential protocols.
